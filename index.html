   </p>I am a former CSGO pro with an impressive tournaments milestone namely <b>PGL Major 2018 and 2019</b>. Other notable tournaments include <b>Krakow Masters 2017, Intel Grand Slam 2017
   and IEM Katowice 2016</b>. Formerly, I have spent a lot of time at home pugging with my friends. As, I was winning almost 99 games out of 100 on average, I decided
   to have a try at a local lan tournaments with some of my friends. Luckily at that time, theres was a talent manager from Natus Vincere at that event and later on I was
   offered a spot on the NaVI Junior Roster Team. With my talent, it only took me <strong> six months</strong> to be promoted into the first-lineup tournaments
   team. Having to stick to only one team, being with Navi is truly impactful as it increase team coordination and also training effectiveness in the long run and ultimately, I retired from CSGO under the Navi Flag.</P>
